# concurrency-in-java
Talks about the multithreading &amp; concurrency in JAVA.

A help isn't shared between two Java Applications,they have their own.

Every JAVA application runs as a single process, nd each process can have multiple threads.
Every thread has a thread stack.

Concurrency basically means that one task doesn't have to complete for the other one to start.
